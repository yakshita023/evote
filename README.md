# 🗳️ Blockchain-Based E-Voting System using Facial Recognition

In a digital age where election integrity and voter verification are more critical than ever, this project presents a secure and efficient **web-based e-voting application**. It leverages **blockchain technology** for transparent vote recording and **facial recognition** for real-time voter authentication—ensuring that each vote is legitimate, tamper-proof, and verifiable.

The backend is powered by **MongoDB**, structured into three primary collections:
- `users`: stores voter data and facial encodings
- `candidates`: stores information about registered candidates
- `elections`: tracks active and historical election details

This system is ideal for organizations or institutions looking to implement reliable, technology-driven election processes.

### 🔍 Folder Descriptions

- **`client/`**:  
  Houses the frontend code for the voting interface, user registration, login, and candidate selection.

- **`server/`**:  
  Backend server logic, including user authentication, facial recognition, database interactions, and communication with the blockchain.

- **`smart_contract/`**:  
  Contains the smart contract(s) written in Solidity, deployed to a local or public Ethereum-compatible blockchain for secure and verifiable voting.

- **`dlib-*.whl`**:  
  Pre-built binary of the Dlib library for Windows, used for facial recognition.

- **`package.json`**:  
  Defines Node.js project metadata, dependencies, and scripts (if Node.js is used).

## ▶️ How to Run

Follow the steps below to install, configure, and run the **Blockchain-Based E-Voting System using Facial Recognition**.

---

### 🧩 Installation and Setup

#### 📦 MongoDB Configuration
1. Open `/server/.env` and add your MongoDB connection URL on **line 2**.
2. Database collections (`users`, `candidates`, `elections`) will be automatically managed via the schema files in `/server/Models`.

#### 📧 Third-Party Email Verification
1. Register your email application (e.g., with Gmail).
2. Generate an **app-specific password** using Google Support.
3. Add your email credentials (EMAIL, PASSWORD) to `/server/.env`.

---

### 🔗 Blockchain & Smart Contract Setup

#### 🪙 Ganache (Local Blockchain)
1. Install [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/).
2. Open it to access 10 free Ethereum accounts, each funded with 100 ETH.
3. Link Ganache to `/smart_contract/truffle-config.js` to sync accounts.

#### 🦊 MetaMask (Browser Extension)
1. Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for Chrome.
2. Import an account using the private keys provided by Ganache.
3. Use this for managing transactions during contract interaction.

#### ⚒️ Compile & Deploy Smart Contract
```bash
cd smart_contract
npm install -g truffle      # Skip if already installed
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```
4. After deployment:
   - Copy the deployed contract **address** to `client/utils/Constant.js`.
   - Copy the `Transaction.json` ABI file from `smart_contract/build/contracts/` to `client/utils/Transaction.json`.

---

### 🧠 Facial Recognition Setup

#### 🐍 Python Environment
Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy os face_recognition
```

> If you face issues installing `face_recognition`, try manually installing `dlib` using:
```bash
pip install dlib-19.24.99-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl
```
> Still having issues? Try **downgrading `numpy`** to a compatible version.

#### 📸 Image Encoding
1. Add user images to the `/Face/` directory.
2. Ensure the image filenames match corresponding usernames.
3. In `/server/Controller/encoded.py`, update **line 6** to specify the correct photo directory.

### 🚀 Running the Web Application

#### Step 1: Start the Client
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

#### Step 2: Start the Server
```bash
cd server
npm install
nodemon main
```

Wait a few moments, then open your browser and access the application to begin the voting process.
